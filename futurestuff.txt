Things I might add in the future if the site needs it 


Adding a blog 
Add a date field to your markdown front matter.
in the main loop collect all metadata into a list called posts
Sort posts by date.
Create a blog index template that iterates over posts
    
dynamic ish navbar 
Create a global list of pages in the loop.
Pass that list to template.render(nav=pages, ...)
