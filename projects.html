<h3 id="election-model">2. 2024 Election Model</h3>
<p>R program that used Selenium to scrape polling data from aggregators.
Accurately predicted vote share in 6 of 7 swing states. Generated
probabilities in line with major betting markets and mainstream
modelers.</p>

<h3 id="first-person-platformer">3. First Person Platformer</h3>
<p>A simple platformer game I made to test out Godot’s capabilities.
Features timed trials, grapple hook, wall running. Overally a pretty fun
character controller to mess around with</p>
