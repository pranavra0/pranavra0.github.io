        <p>Here are a few things I am working on.</p>
<h3>1. SYN -  Sign Language Recognition</h3>
<p>Full-stack web app for real time ASL recognition using webcam input. Model built with a custom dataset and MediaPipe Hands. Model served via REST API.</p>

<h3>2. 2024 Election Model</h3>
<p>R program that used Selenium to scrape polling data from aggregators. Accurately predicted vote share in 6 of 7 swing states. Generated probabilities in line with major betting markets and mainstream modelers. </p>

<h3>3. First Person Platformer</h3>
<p>A simple platformer game I made to test out Godot's capabilities. Features timed trials, grapple hook, wall running. Overally a pretty fun character controller to mess around with </p>
