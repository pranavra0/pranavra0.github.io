    <h3 id="decide-it">2. Decide It!</h3>
    <p>A voting platform so groups can make choices quickly. Live
    updates using WebSockets. I tried to avoid using JS frameworks for
    this project.</p>

    <h3 id="election-model">3. 2024 Election Model</h3>
    <p>R program that used Selenium to scrape polling data from
    aggregators. Accurately predicted vote share in 6 of 7 swing states.
    Generated probabilities in line with major betting markets and
    mainstream modelers.</p>

    <h3 id="first-person-platformer">4. First Person Platformer</h3>
    <p>A simple platformer game I made to test out Godot’s capabilities.
    Features timed trials, grapple hook, wall running. Overall a pretty
    fun character controller to mess around with.</p>
