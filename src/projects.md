### 2. Decide It!
A voting platform so groups can make choices quickly. Live updates using WebSockets. I tried to avoid using JS frameworks for this project.

### 3. 2024 Election Model
R program that used Selenium to scrape polling data from aggregators. Accurately predicted vote share in 6 of 7 swing states. Generated probabilities in line with major betting markets and mainstream modelers.

### 4. First Person Platformer
A simple platformer game I made to test out Godot's capabilities. Features timed trials, grapple hook, wall running. Overall a pretty fun character controller to mess around with.
