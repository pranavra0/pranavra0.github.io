This first post serves as a living document to test the [typographic hierarchy](#) of the site. The goal is to ensure that the content remains readable.

## Subheadings are Italicized

`h2` elements are set to `font-style: italic`. 

### A Third Level Header

Here is a demonstration of inline elements. You can have **bold text** for emphasis, or *standard italics* for foreign words or book titles.

> \- Stendhal

The blockquote above should feature a left border and italicized text. Below, we test lists to ensure the padding allows the bullets to sit comfortably within the flow.

* First item in an unordered list.
* Second item, which contains a [nested link](#)
* Third item.

And here is a numbered list to check alignment:

1. Download the repository.
2. Run the build script: `./build.sh`
3. Verify the output.

## Images and Media

Below is a placeholder image. It should scale down on mobile devices because of the `max-width: 100%` rule.

Finally, this paragraph exists to test the bottom margin and ensure the footer doesn't crowd the content.
