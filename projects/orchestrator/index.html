    <h1>The Orchestrator</h1>
    <p style="color: #888; margin-bottom: 2rem;">Container orchestration from scratch for small projects.</p>

    <div class="project-body">
        <p>This was for my software engineering capstone project. I was frustrated with how overkill Kubernetes felt for smaller projects, so I decided to attempt to make my own orchestrator.</p>
<p>It was definitely much harder than I initially assumed, but it illustrates how orchestrators work and serves as a solid system for very small-scale projects.</p>
